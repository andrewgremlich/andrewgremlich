# Hello there!

I'm a front end web developer. The front world is just so huge, that I am consistently engaged in the content!

I write occasionally to [my development blog](https://gremlich/dev) and [my life blog](https://gremlich.me).

I have interest in learning Rust => Webassembly so that I could use it with my JavaScript code. I am also interested in learning computer science principles.
