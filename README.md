I am an experienced front-end web developer in React, Angular, and plain Vanilla JavaScript! I enjoy doing a job well done. For me, that usually means that code is clean and understandable. To make clean and understandable code, I should also know what the code is doing.

My career has been through automotive, religious, packaging, and ecommerce groups, and it has been very interesting to learn from all of them! In addition to previously mentioned skills, I also gained skills in Shell Scripting, JavaScript Server Runtimes, and Database management.

I currently help organize UtahJS Lehi meetups. I have met so many new and young developers that are hoping to get into the tech industry. I hope that I can adequately help and prepare them for their career.

I write occasionally to [my development blog](https://gremlich.dev) and [my life blog](https://gremlich.me).

I am learning various different web technologies: from WebAssembly, WebRTC, and different user experiences. Also in my study, I am looking to deepen my understanding of computer science principles in order to make efficient web software.
