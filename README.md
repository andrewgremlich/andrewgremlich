## About Me

I am an experienced full-stack software engineer with a strong focus on writing clean, maintainable code. I take pride in ensuring my code is both understandable and effective, which means fully grasping its purpose and functionality.

I currently help organize UtahJS Lehi meetups. I write occasionally to my development blog and my life blog. I am learning various different web technologies: from WebAssembly to IAAS like AWS CDK. Also in my study, I am looking to deepen my understanding of computer science principles in order to make efficient web software.

I write occasionally to [my blog](https://gremlich.me). Follow me there!
