## About Me

I am an experienced software engineer, and my expertise covers many different areas! I enjoy doing a job well done. For me, that usually means that code is clean and understandable. To make clean and understandable code, I should also know what the code is doing.

I currently help organize UtahJS Lehi meetups. I have met so many new and young developers that are hoping to get into the tech industry. I hope that I can adequately help and prepare them for their career.

I write occasionally to [my development blog](https://gremlich.dev) and [my life blog](https://gremlich.me).

I am learning various different web technologies: from WebAssembly to IAAS like AWS CDK. Also in my study, I am looking to deepen my understanding of computer science principles in order to make efficient web software.
