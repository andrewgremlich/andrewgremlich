I'm a front end web developer. The front world is just so huge, that I am consistently engaged in the content!

I currently help organize UtahJS Lehi meetups. It's fun meeting and relating to developers!

I write occasionally to [my development blog](https://gremlich.dev) and [my life blog](https://gremlich.me).

I am learning Rust => Webassembly so that I could use it with my JavaScript code. I am also learning computer science principles, and seeing how those relate to my code.
