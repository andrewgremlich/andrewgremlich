# Hello there!

I'm a programmer. It almost seems like I'm a general purpose programmer that likes to learn whatever. Just give me time, and I'll give myself diligence and patience. With that, I'll try my best to learn!

I do try and shoot for the languages that are making an impact. I am currently using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Rust.

I do have a goal of trying to contribute in the community, but I'll keep with my personal and work projects for now.

I write occasionally to [my development blog](https://gremlich/dev) and [my life blog](https://gremlich.me).

I am learning how to organize files better in a monorepo like NX and I am learning Rust.
